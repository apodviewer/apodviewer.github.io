    What does Orion rising look like to a camera? During this time of the year, the famous constellation is visible to the southeast just after sunset.

An entire section of the night sky that includes Orion was photographed rising above Śnieżka, a mountain on the border between Poland and the Czech Republic.  The long duration exposure sequence brings up many faint features including the Orion and Flame Nebulas, both encompassed by the curving Barnard's Loop.
