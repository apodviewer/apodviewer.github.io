    Spiral galaxy NGC 1097 shines in southern skies, about 45 million light-years away in the heated constellation Fornax.

This very deep exposure hints of faint, mysterious jets, seen to extend well beyond the bluish arms. In fact, four faint jets are ultimately recognized in optical images of NGC 1097. The jets trace an X centered on the galaxy's nucleus, but probably don't originate there.
