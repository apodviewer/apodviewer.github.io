    Orbiting 400 kilometers above Quebec, Canada, planet Earth, the International Space Station Expedition 59 crew captured this snapshot of the broad St. Lawrence River and curiously circular Lake Manicouagan on April 11.

The ancient crater is very conspicuous from orbit, a visible reminder that Earth is vulnerable to rocks from space.
