    A darkened and mysterious north polar region known to some as Mordor Macula caps this premier high-resolution view.

The combined blue, red, and infrared data was processed to enhance colors and follow variations in Charon's surface properties with a resolution of about 2.9 kilometers (1.8 miles).
