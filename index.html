    Gravitational lensing by the galaxy cluster MACS0647 -- in which the massive foreground cluster distorts and lenses the light emitted by distant background galaxies along the line of sight — is on vivid display here in this recent multi-color infrared image from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).  In particular, the background source MACS0647-JD is seen to be lensed three times by the cluster.  When first discovered with the Hubble Space Telescope, MACS0647-JD was observed as an amorphous blob.  With Webb though, this single source is revealed to be a pair or small group of galaxies.
