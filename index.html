    Some stars explode in slow motion.  Rare, massive Wolf-Rayet stars are so tumultuous and hot that they are slowly disintegrating right before our telescopes.

Wolf-Rayet star WR 124, visible near the featured image center and spanning six light years across, is thus creating the surrounding nebula known as M1-67.  Details of why this star has been slowly blowing itself apart over the past 20,000 years remains a topic of research.
