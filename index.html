    How does your favorite planet spin? Does it spin rapidly around a nearly vertical axis, or horizontally, or backwards?  The featured video animates NASA images of all eight planets in our Solar System to show them spinning side-by-side for an easy comparison. In the time-lapse video, a day on Earth -- one Earth rotation -- takes just a few seconds.  Jupiter rotates the fastest, while Venus spins not only the slowest (can you see it?), but backwards.  The inner rocky planets, across the top, most certainly underwent dramatic spin-altering collisions during the early days of the Solar System.  The reasons why planets spin and tilt as they do remains a topic of research with much insight gained from modern computer modeling and the recent discovery and analysis of hundreds of exoplanets: planets orbiting other stars.
