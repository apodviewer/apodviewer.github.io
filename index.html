    No, the Moon is not a bow, and no, it did not shoot out a plane like an arrow. What is pictured is a chance superposition.

Far in the distance, well behind the plane, the crescent Moon also appears slightly reddened. Captured early last month from Bolton, UK, the featured image was taken so soon after sunrise that the plane was sunlit from below, as was its contrail.
