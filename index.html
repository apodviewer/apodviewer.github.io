    Would you like to see a total eclipse of the Sun?  If so, do any friends or relatives live near the path of next April's eclipse?  If yes again, then you might want to arrange a well-timed visit. Next April 8, the path of a total solar eclipse will cross North America from western Mexico to eastern Canada, entering the USA in southern Texas and exiting in northern Maine.  All of North America will experience the least a partial solar eclipse.  Featured here is a map of the path of totality.  Many people who have seen a total solar eclipse tell stories about it for the rest of their lives.  As a warmup, an annular solar eclipse will be visible later this year -- in mid-October.
