    Many wonders are visible when flying over the Earth at night.  Such visual spectacles occur every day for astronauts in low Earth orbit, but the featured video captured several from the International Space Station (ISS) in 2011 and set them to rousing music.  Passing below are white clouds, orange city lights, lightning flashes in thunderstorms, and dark blue seas.  On the horizon is the golden haze of Earth's thin atmosphere, frequently decorated by dancing auroras as the video progresses.  The green parts of auroras typically remain below the space station, but the station flies right through the red and purple auroral peaks.  Solar panels of the ISS are seen around the frame edges.
