    <meta name="description" content="The surface of our Sun is constantly changing.  Some years it is quiet, showing relatively few sunspots and active regions.

Reacting to magnetism, our Sun's surface goes through periods of relative calm, called Solar Minimum and relative unrest, called Solar Maximum, every 11 years.
