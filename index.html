    How soon do jets form when a supernova gives birth to a neutron star?  The Africa Nebula provides clues.  This supernova remnant surrounds Circinus X-1, an X-ray emitting neutron star and the companion star it orbits.  The image, from the ThunderKAT collaboration on the MeerKAT radio telescope situated in South Africa, shows the bright core-and-lobe structure of Cir X-1’s currently active jets inside the nebula.  A mere 4600 years old, Cir X-1 could be the "Little Sister" of microquasar SS 433*.  However, the newly discovered bubble exiting from a ring-like hole in the upper right of the nebula, along with a ring to the bottom left, demonstrate that other jets previously existed.  Computer simulations indicate those jets formed within 100 years of the explosion and lasted up to 1000 years.
