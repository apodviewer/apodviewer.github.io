    This is the mess that is left when a star explodes.  The Crab Nebula, the result of a supernova seen in 1054 AD, is filled with mysterious filaments.  The filaments are not only tremendously complex, but appear to have less mass than expelled in the original supernova and a higher speed than expected from a free explosion.  The featured image, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, is presented in three colors chosen for scientific interest.  The Crab Nebula spans about 10 light-years.
