    You might not immediately recognize this street map of a neighborhood in Jyväskylä, Finland, planet Earth.

As ice crystals formed in the atmosphere overhead, street lights spilling illumination into the sky above produced visible light pillars, their ethereal appearance due to specular reflections from the fluttering crystals' flat surfaces.
