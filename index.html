    The giant galaxy cataloged as LEDA 1313424 is about two and a half times the size of our own Milky Way.

Known as a collisional ring galaxy it has nine rings confirmed by telescopic observations, rippling from its center like waves from a pebble dropped into a pond. Of course, the pebble dropped into the Bullseye galaxy was a galaxy itself.
