In the unwrapped image, the spherical distortion of the reflection in Aldrin's helmet has been reversed.  The transformed view features Armstrong himself from Aldrin's perspective. Since Armstrong took the original picture, today the image represents a fifty-four year old lunar selfie.  Aldrin's visor reflection in the original image appears here on the left.
