    Can you find the Rosette Nebula? The red flowery-looking nebula just above the image center may seem a good choice, but that's not it.  The famous Rosette Nebula is really located on the lower right, here colored blue and white, and connected to the other nebulas by gold-colored filaments.  Because the featured image of Rosette's field is so wide, and because of its deep red exposure, it seems to contain other flowers.  Designated NGC 2237, the center of the Rosette Nebula is populated by the bright blue stars of open cluster NGC 2244, whose winds and energetic light are evacuating the nebula's center.
